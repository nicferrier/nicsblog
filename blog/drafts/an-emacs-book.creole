= an Emacs book - maybe =

I've thought for a long time about writing an Emacs book. The recent
release
of
[[http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1934356980/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1|Practical VIM]]
I have thought more about it. The VIM book is very nice. And it's
telling that a modern book about VIM (using the terminal is encouraged
in this book!) is being sold. Many younger programmers are coming to
VIM as a great text editing tool.

Emacs is experiencing something of an increase in popularity too. I
believe this is directly correlated with a similar decrease in
homogenity in our industry. In short, the programming world is
fracturing, many different languages are being picked up, new
languages are being produced and Emacs and VIM are relatively quick
ways to build tooling for new languages.

Languages that are less Emacs-able, like Java, seem to me to be seeing
something of a decline.

If my theory is right then the upsurge won't last unless we Emacs
advocates try and capitalize on it by trying hard to make good tools
for the new languages and by documenting Emacs for the new generation
of programmers.

=== reasons why people are considering Emacs ===

For one thing there's a whole generation of people who have never used
Emacs and who aren't necessarily biased against it because of a poor
experience. And Emacs has massively improved over the last 10 years,
so a lot of the things that may have driven people away in the past
have got better.

Two languages in specific seem to be driving users to Emacs, Clojure
and JavaScript. Both are well suited to being developed in Emacs
because of the parenthetical nature of both languages, Clojure is a
straight up Lisp and JavaScript has a Lisp-y nature with it's style of
many nested functions (originally JavaScript was a Scheme, of course).

But neither of these languages is a good reason to use Emacs and for
us Emacs advocates it's almost inevitably the path to
disappointment. Better tools will be made for Clojure and JavaScript
and the users will drift away. We've seen it time and time again.

=== what's the right reason to use Emacs? ===

The right reason to use Emacs is that it's a tool for building editing
tools. 

VIM is a superior editor out of the box for nearly every conceivable
editing task. But Emacs, with only a little customization, is soon
just as good. And just as good specifically for you. And with a little
more customization it's absolutely specifically your tool, crafted to
your hands. Just like any master craftsmen the best programmers make
their own tools. VIM users tend to make those tools out of the Unix
shell. But in Emacs we think we have a better solution, a more
flexible solution. Sometimes we can use the Unix way, sometimes we can
use other methods.

The point about Emacs is it's hackability, the whole design of the
system encourages people to make it better, for them.

This is also a fatal flaw for encouraging new people to use
it. Especially people who aren't aware that programming is something
of a craft.

It's also a fatal flaw for documenting Emacs. Much of the goodness of
Emacs is add ons. One of the key things that makes Emacs great for
Clojure users, //paredit//, doesn't even come with standard Emacs. And
it's been superseeded by a newer replacement, //smartparens//.

Whole chunks of Emacs clearly need replacing, //dired// is a particular
abomination in my view. So anything that gets written may be woefully
out of date in a few years.

How is anyone supposed to represent that dynamism in a positive way in
a book?

=== gotta try ===

It does seem someone should try and provide a decent medium level
introduction to Emacs. People do expect such things to be around, they
might even enjoy reading it. Certainly the VIM book is very good to
dip into.

I like the idea of a tips book. It seems like the right thing for an
editor.
